[INFO] HEAT AND COLD
From now, the world in minecraft will have a new attribute: TEMPERATURE!
It will have influence on your energy and your strength. If the temperature
gets higher than 40° you have to drink something and also you have to seek 
shelter in the shadow! If it gets to cold you have to dress warmer, otherwise
you will freeze to death. Be careful:
DO NOT STAY NEAR LAVA FOR TOO LONG! IT WILL BURN YOU!
